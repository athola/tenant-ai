    Treat everyone equally. All applicants and prospects must be treated the same regardless of race, color, religion, sex, disability, familial status, or national origin, as protected by the Fair Housing Act and the Iowa Civil Rights Act.
    Do not ""steer"" prospects. Avoid making comments that could be interpreted as steering tenants toward or away from certain neighborhoods or units based on a protected class.
",,Screening and Application,,
"1211455196964333",2025-09-24,,2025-09-24,Intake and Initial Response,,,,,,,"When a new lead comes in from an online listing or a call, act fast. The speed of your response is critical.
    Respond to every inquiry. Under fair housing laws, you must respond to everyone equally and consistently to avoid the appearance of bias. Even if you're screening, don't ghost a prospect.
    Use a standardized email or text template for your first response. This ensures consistency and efficiency. The template should acknowledge their inquiry and provide a link to your pre-screening criteria (e.g., minimum income, credit score, no prior evictions).
    Offer specific showing times. Avoid a long back-and-forth about scheduling. Provide a few blocks of time for showings, such as ""Tuesday from 4-5 PM and Saturday from 10-11 AM."" This helps manage your time and volume.

"1211455196964334",2025-09-24,,2025-09-24,Pre-Screening and Information Gathering,,,,,,,"Before you meet in person, you can filter out those who are unlikely to qualify.
    Request a pre-screening form or ask qualifying questions. Ask about their desired move-in date, household size, pets, and why they're moving. This helps you determine if the unit is a good fit and if they're a serious prospect.
    Watch for red flags. Be aware of common red flags that may signal a problematic tenant, such as a large number of occupants showing up to the showing, a sense of extreme urgency to move in (which may indicate a prior eviction), or an unwillingness to provide basic information.
    Refer them to your application. If they meet the initial criteria and are still interested, direct them to your online application. Make it clear that they need to submit an application to be considered for the unit.

"1211455196964335",2025-09-24,,2025-09-24,Scheduling and Confirmation,,,,,,,"Once a prospect is qualified and has expressed a serious interest, you can schedule a formal showing.
    Use an online scheduling tool. This automates the process and sends reminders, reducing the likelihood of no-shows.
    Send a confirmation message. Always confirm the appointment via email or text. This reinforces the appointment and provides a record of communication. The message should include the date, time, and exact meeting location.
    Confirm all appointments. Even with a scheduling tool, a personal confirmation can make a good impression and reinforce professionalism.

    Written Consent: Ensure you have a signed rental application that includes a clause giving you permission to contact previous landlords. Without this, you could be violating the applicant's privacy rights.
    Applicant Information: Have the applicant's name, the address of the previous rental, the dates of tenancy they provided, and the monthly rent amount they claim they paid.
    Verification: Cross-reference the previous landlord's information to make sure they are, in fact, the owner or a legitimate property manager. You can do this by checking county tax records or searching for the management company online.

"1211455196964290",2025-09-24,,2025-09-24,Phone Script,,,,,,,"Part 1: Introduction
""Hello, my name is [Your Name] from [Your Company/Property Name]. I'm calling about a rental application for [Applicant's Name]. They listed you as a previous landlord. Is this a good time to speak?""

    If yes: ""Thank you. I have their written consent to contact you to verify some information they provided on their application.""
    If no: ""I understand. What would be a better time for me to call you back?""

Part 2: Verification Questions
This section is for confirming the basic facts and is a crucial first step in spotting a fake reference.
    ""Can you confirm that [Applicant's Name] was a tenant at [Previous Property Address]?""
    ""What were the dates of their tenancy?"" (Compare this to what the applicant provided.)
    ""Was the monthly rent amount $[Rent Amount]?"" (Compare this to the applicant's information. A large discrepancy could be a red flag.)
    ""Were there any other occupants (on or off the lease)?""

Part 3: Behavioral Questions
These questions delve into the tenant's habits and character. Focus on objective, fact-based questions rather than subjective opinions.
    ""Did the tenant consistently pay rent on time and in full?""
        Follow-up: ""Were there any late payments or missed payments?""
    ""Did they give proper written notice before moving out?"" (This is an important indicator of a responsible tenant.)
    ""How did they maintain the property? Was it left in good condition when they moved out?""
        Follow-up: ""Did you need to make any deductions from their security deposit for damages beyond normal wear and tear?""
    ""Were there any lease violations, such as unauthorized pets, unauthorized occupants, or smoking in the unit?""
    ""Did you ever receive any complaints from neighbors or other tenants about noise or behavior?""
    ""Would you rent to this person again?"" (This is often the most telling question. A simple ""yes"" is a strong positive, while hesitation or a ""no"" can indicate a problem. Be prepared to ask for a brief, factual reason why without prying into personal matters.)

Part 4: Closing
""Thank you so much for your time and for providing this information. It's a great help in our screening process. Have a good day.""",,Contact previous landlords for references.,,
