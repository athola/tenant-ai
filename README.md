# Agentic Property Orchestrator

Agentic Property Orchestrator is a Rust-based web service that unifies automated workflows across text, email, phone, and AppFolio tenant management. The initial binary is a lightweight Axum server that will evolve into a multi-channel automation hub for property management teams.

## Getting Started

```bash
cargo run
```

The server currently exposes a single `/health` endpoint while deeper workflow integrations are designed in the docs.

## Documentation

Project plans live under `docs/` and cover the roadmap, architecture, and milestone breakdowns for upcoming merge requests.
